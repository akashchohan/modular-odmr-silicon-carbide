# Experimental Results

This directory contains processed data and plots from ODMR experiments.

Subfolders:
- `odmr_dips/` — Extracted resonance dips from fluorescence modulation
- `resonance_scans/` — Frequency sweep data
- `lockin_plots/` — Software lock-in amplifier processed signals

This data demonstrates successful detection of SiC spin resonance transitions.
