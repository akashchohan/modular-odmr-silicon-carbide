# Project Overview

This project presents a fully working, low-cost, modular ODMR system built using Silicon Carbide (SiC) defects at room temperature.

The main goals were:

1. Demonstrate ODMR using accessible electronics
2. Build a modular RF + optical + DAQ system
3. Implement both hardware and software lock-in detection
4. Develop Python GUIs for complete system control
5. Produce a reproducible quantum sensing platform for research and teaching

The system integrates:

- A custom RF synthesizer (Si5351)
- ADF4351 GHz source
- 808 nm laser excitation
- Photodiode-based fluorescence detection
- Red Pitaya for digitization and lock-in
- Python GUIs for control, acquisition, and processing

All subsystems were designed, assembled, tested, and calibrated independently before full system integration.
