# Measurement Protocol

1. Power on laser diode and stabilize temperature
2. Align optical path and verify fluorescence signal
3. Select RF source (Si5351 or ADF4351)
4. Sweep RF frequency across expected resonance
5. Acquire photodiode signal via Red Pitaya
6. Apply lock-in detection (hardware or software)
7. Record ODMR dips and resonance curves
8. Save plots and raw data for analysis
