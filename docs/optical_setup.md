# Optical Setup

The optical subsystem is responsible for exciting SiC defect centers and collecting their fluorescence response.

## Components Used
- 808 nm laser diode module
- Peltier (TEC) cooling system
- Heat sink and fan assembly
- Optical lenses (L1, L2)
- Optical filters
- Photodiode detector (APD)

## Temperature Control
The laser diode is actively cooled using a Peltier module to achieve stable operation down to approximately −4 °C. Temperature stability is critical for consistent excitation power and spectral behavior.

## Alignment Procedure
1. A green laser is used to define the optical path.
2. Lenses are adjusted to focus the excitation beam onto the SiC sample.
3. Fluorescence is collected through lens L2 and directed onto the photodiode.
4. Optical mounts are fixed once maximum signal is obtained.

This alignment process ensures repeatable fluorescence collection during RF sweeps.
