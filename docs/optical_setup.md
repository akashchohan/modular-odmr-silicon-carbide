# Optical Setup

The optical subsystem provides controlled excitation and fluorescence collection.

### Components

- 808 nm laser diode module
- TEC cooling stage (Peltier + heatsink)
- Temperature sensor + control loop
- Optical mounts
- Lenses L1 and L2
- Bandpass filters
- Photodiode detector

### Alignment Procedure

1. Use green alignment laser to define beam path.
2. Place SiC sample at focal point between L1 and L2.
3. Adjust photodiode position until maximum fluorescence is detected.
4. Lock optics using mounts and screws.

### Operating Conditions

- Laser current: ∼200–350 mA
- Temperature: –4°C to ambient
- Spot size: adjusted to illuminate single defect region
